Simple Chrome Extension for creating new documents in Google Drive with multi-user support.

and [Firefox Addon Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/google-quick-create-matrix/)!

This project is finished and will no longer get updates due to all features being implanted, low user count, and this problem being solved by Arc browser.

To minify for production, install dependencies with `pnpm i` then `pnpm run build`
